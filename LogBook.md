# Log book

## 2024/07/18 (4am)
I think I will probably start by developing a common application often used as an example for microservices, like a blog or an e-commerce application (but probably more like a personal blog with funky features, haha). I will start by making a small monolith and deploy it on AWS, so I can have a running application. Then I will gradually split it into microservices by introducing a message broker, multiple databases, and all the challenging aspects related to microservices.
